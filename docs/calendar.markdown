Calendar
========

There are two different views for the calendar:

- The project view with filters (available from the board)
- The user view (available from the dashboard and from the user section)

At this time the calendar is able to display these information:

- Tasks with a due date, displayed at the top. The date can be changed by moving the task to another day.
- Subtask time tracking, each recorded time slot will be shown in the calendar.
