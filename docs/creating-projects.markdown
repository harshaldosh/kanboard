Creating projects
=================

Kanboard can handle multiple projects. There are two kinds of project:

- Project with mutliple users (you work in team)
- Private project for a single user

Creating projects for multiple users
-------------------------------------

- Only administrators can create those projects
- User management is available

From the dashboard, click on the link **New project**.
Then the form appears:

It's very easy, you just have to find a name for your project!

Creating a private project
--------------------------

- Everybody can create a private project
- There is **NO** user management
- Only the owner and administrators can access to the project

From the dashboard, click on the link **New private project**.

Note: project names must be unique across the application.
